    WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
    WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
    THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    WHEN I click into a time block
    THEN I can enter an event
    WHEN I click the save button for that time block
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    WHEN I refresh the page
